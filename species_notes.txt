Notes about intermediate steps in the analysis (bad, I know!).

1. Looked at phenology plots made with GAMs to come up with reasonable number of 
generations for each species x year. Then mixture models will choose M.

2. Ran Matechou model for all species, years, and reasonable M values. 
Also tried Annual GDD vs latitude as covariates.

Noticed lots of missing data (NA's), traced to a bug of sites being mismatched.
Will need to be rerun for some species (all species?)
Right now, look at extent of problem and choose lat vs gdd for site covariate.

Results from my R server
Black Swallowtail: 1 yr missing, lat .58 weight
European skipper: 1 yr missing from 2M, many missing from 1M-big problem. lat even with gdd
Hackberry Emperor: 1 yr missing, lat .82 weight
Hobomok skipper: only 1M missing, about half. Lat .66 for 2M. similar problem to European skipper
Juvenal's duskywing: only 1 year modeled, did other miss cutoff??
Least Skipper: 2 years missing, gdd .67.
Little Glassywing: all 1M missing, none from 2/3M. lat .6
N Broken dash: all 1M missing, few years met cutoff, reran with lowered cutoff (5)
  all 1M still missing, lat .81
Viceroy: 1 yr missing, lat .14 vs .13 for 3M, gdd .49 vs .25 for 4M
Wild Indigo duskywing: none missing, gdd .55
Zabulon skipper: none missing, gdd .54

Results from slurm/sesync
E Tiger Swallowtail: 3 years missing, lat .5 vs gdd .45, duplicate gdd .51
Spicebush Swallowtail: none missing, lat .62
Silver-spotted skipper: lots of errors, maybe run over?
Red-spotted purple: missing 2 years, lat .66
Peck's skipper: none missing, gdd .84
missing all Common Wood Nymph, Little Wood Satyr, N Pearley Eye

Should I expand possible Min/MaxBrood?? Maybe just max brood by 1 to ensure 
mixture model mode selection works and stops at the plausible M.
